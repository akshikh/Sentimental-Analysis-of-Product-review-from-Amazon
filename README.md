# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Product-review-from-Amazon

Overview of the Analysis
I used VADER Sentiment Analysis to score historical data of Amazon reviews, categorizing each review as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content. The analysis revealed that higher-rated reviews (4 and 5 stars) tend to be more positive, while lower-rated reviews (1 and 2 stars) are more negative. Neutral sentiments are consistent across all ratings but slightly more common in lower-rated reviews.

Application in Social Media and Public Analysis
Sentiment analysis, like the one conducted here, can be highly useful in social media and public opinion analysis. Companies can monitor social media to gauge public sentiment about their products or services, identify trends, and manage brand reputation. Similarly, politicians and policymakers can use sentiment analysis to understand public opinion on various issues, shaping campaign strategies and policy decisions accordingly. This methodology provides a powerful tool for organizations to monitor, understand, and respond to public sentiment effectively.

From the sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews, it can be understood that:

Reviews are generally more positive as the rating score increases. The positive sentiment increases progressively from score 1 to score 5, with the highest positive sentiment associated with 5-star reviews.

Negative sentiment is more prevalent in lower-rated reviews. The highest negative sentiment is associated with 1-star reviews, and it decreases as the rating score increases, with 5-star reviews showing the least negative sentiment.

Neutral sentiment is fairly consistent across all scores but shows a slight decrease as the rating score increases. This means that neutral content is present in reviews regardless of the rating but is slightly more common in lower-rated reviews.


Overall, the data suggests that higher-rated reviews (4 and 5 stars) tend to be more positive, while lower-rated reviews (1 and 2 stars) tend to be more negative. Neutral sentiments are present throughout but are more consistent and slightly higher in lower ratings.
