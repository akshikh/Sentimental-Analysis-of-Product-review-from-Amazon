From the sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews, it can be understood that:

Reviews are generally more positive as the rating score increases. The positive sentiment increases progressively from score 1 to score 5, with the highest positive sentiment associated with 5-star reviews.

Negative sentiment is more prevalent in lower-rated reviews. The highest negative sentiment is associated with 1-star reviews, and it decreases as the rating score increases, with 5-star reviews showing the least negative sentiment.

Neutral sentiment is fairly consistent across all scores but shows a slight decrease as the rating score increases. This means that neutral content is present in reviews regardless of the rating but is slightly more common in lower-rated reviews.


Overall, the data suggests that higher-rated reviews (4 and 5 stars) tend to be more positive, while lower-rated reviews (1 and 2 stars) tend to be more negative. Neutral sentiments are present throughout but are more consistent and slightly higher in lower ratings.
